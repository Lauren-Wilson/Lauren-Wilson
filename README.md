👋 Hi, I'm Lauren Wilson.

💼 I'm an Associate Data Scientist at G.E.H.A with a background in time series forecasting, test-and-learn, product analysis, and machine learning in the cloud.

🚀 I'm interested in all things healthcare | product analytics | business optimization, specifically improving the user's experience & helping to identify and correct business bottlenecks and blindspots. My work has been focused on A/B testing to determine campaign lift, reporting & insights, and projecting member enrollment using Python, R, & SQL.

🌱 I'm currently working on obtaining my AWS Solutions Architect or Azure Data Scientsit certification to widen my deployment abilities and combine with my Machine Learning skillset.

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on research based | exploratory projects in computer vision or LLMs. I enjoy advocating for ethical and representative data projects. You can also find me connecting people to resources for careers in tech or in the [Data Angels](https://www.dataangels.org/) Slack community.
