ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Lauren Wilson.

ðŸ’¼ I'm a data scientist currently teaching Data Science in San Antonio, with a background in wellness tech.

ðŸš€ I'm interested in all things product analytics and optimization, specifically analyzing the user experience. My work has been focused in A/B testing, recommendation engines, reporting & insights, and ELT pipelines using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PySpark, and AWS resources.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on obtaining my AWS Solutions Architect certification to widen my deployment abilities and combine with my Machine Learning skillset.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on research based/exploratory projects in computer vision. I enjoy advocating for ethical and representative data professionals. You can also find me connecting people to resources for careers in tech or in the [Data Angels](https://www.dataangels.org/) Slack community.
